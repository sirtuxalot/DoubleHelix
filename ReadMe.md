# DoubleHelix

## This repo my public code for my [3D Printed Double Helix Lamp](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4812520)

The base code for this was the DemoReel100 example in the FastLED library, then I added...
- The example code for the Pride2015 FastLED example
- Two code examples (Chaser and Breathing Effect) from "Life Meet Lightnings" [here](http://lifemeetlightning.com/all-the-led-lights/fastled-tutorial-code/), the latter was duplicated and renamed with fitting names
- Finally, I adde some sparkle to the visualization by worked out how to add the baked in glitter affect to the included and added sequences.

### I am by no means a stellar Arduino/C++ developer but I do understand the basics, and enough to splice code together to get the result I am looking for.  Even then I am willing to seek out help.
